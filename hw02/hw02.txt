Hw02 Short Answer Questions

1. Int can be used to declare and initialize a variable in the same line, whereas const int cannot be changed after you initialize the variable.

2. Function declarations (AKA prototypes) tell the compiler the name and type of function depending on where you put it whereas function definitions specify the functions and can also act as a declaration.

3. Unsigned integers can be used to hold large numbers as a way to devote to the value based on the bit that can indicate the sign and you can use them anywhere that has a negative number such as an array index.

4. In the given C++ code, the sum variable is not initialized as a value.  In order to fix that, you have to set the variable to 0.

Correct output:
int sum=0;
    for(int i=0; i<1000; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
printf("Sum of 0 to 999 is %d\n", sum);

5. The code will not compile since there is only one equal (=) sign in the if statement condition and print is not declared as a C++ identifier.  In order to fix those errors, you have to put two equal signs in the if statement condition and use printf inside the curly brackets.

Correct output:
int n = 1;
	if(n == 0) {
		printf("n is zero\n");
	}

6. In order to determine the number of bytes in a C++ datatype, put the datatype name first in parentheses, use the sizeof operator, and put the C++ format code in the parentheses.
*Ex: printf("%d\n", (datatype)sizeof(datatype));*
	Char - 1
	Short - 2
	Int - 4
	Long - 8 (it can also be 4)
*Operating system - macOS*
